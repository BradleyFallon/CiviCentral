## Guiding Principles

When designing the user interface for your application, keep the following principles in mind:

1. **Choose a color scheme:** Select a color palette that reflects the tone of your application. You can use tools like [Adobe Color](https://color.adobe.com/create/color-wheel) or [Coolors.co](https://coolors.co/) to help you pick a color scheme. Remember to consider accessibility and contrast for readability.

```
:root {
  --civi-dark: #23226f;
  --civi-muted: #6f92b4;
  --civi-bright: #58FFED;
  --civi-accent: #29D958;
  --civi-light: #d9fabd;
}
```

2. **Typography:** Choose appropriate fonts for your application. Use a limited number of font families (1-2) and ensure that they are readable and suitable for your content. Google Fonts (https://fonts.google.com/) is an excellent resource for finding free, high-quality fonts.

```
/* Typography */
body {
  background-color: var(--civi-light);
  color: var(--civi-dark);
  font-family: 'Roboto', sans-serif;
  line-height: 1.6;
}

h1, h2, h3, h4, h5, h6 {
  font-family: 'Lato', sans-serif;
}
```

3. **Layout:** Organize your content and components in a logical, consistent manner. You can use a grid system to create a structured layout. Many CSS frameworks like Bootstrap, Bulma, or Tailwind CSS have built-in grid systems you can use.

Using Material-UI


4. **Navigation:** Make sure your navigation is clear and easy to understand. Use descriptive labels for menu items and ensure that users can quickly access the most important sections of your application.



5. **Whitespace:** Use whitespace to create a visual hierarchy and improve readability. This includes margins, padding, and line spacing.

6. **Responsive design:** Ensure that your application works well on various screen sizes and devices. You can use CSS media queries or CSS frameworks with responsive features to achieve this.

7. **Interaction feedback:** Provide users with feedback when they interact with your application, such as hover effects for buttons, animations for transitions, and messages for form submissions.

8. **Consistency:** Make sure your design is consistent throughout the application, including colors, fonts, and component styles.

9. **Accessibility:** Ensure your design is accessible for all users, including those with disabilities. This includes using appropriate color contrast, providing alternative text for images, and making sure your application is navigable using a keyboard.

10. **Testing:** Test your design with real users to gather feedback and make improvements based on their experiences.

## Designing the UI

To design pages and workflows, follow these steps:

1. Identify key pages: Determine the main pages of your app based on the components and user interactions. Some examples are: homepage (discussion list), discussion detail, issue list, issue detail, expert analysis list, expert analysis detail, user profile, user settings, login/signup page.

2. Create wireframes: Sketch out rough wireframes for each page, focusing on layout, content hierarchy, and user interactions. At this stage, you can use simple boxes and placeholder text to represent components.

3. Define user flows: Map out how users will navigate through your app. For example, from the homepage, a user might click on a discussion title to see the details, and then click on a comment to reply.

4. Design the UI: Using your wireframes and user flows as a guide, design the user interface for each page. Incorporate the Material-UI components and your color scheme, typography, and other design elements. You may want to use a design tool like Figma, Adobe XD, or Sketch to create high-fidelity mockups.

5. Review and iterate: Review your designs with stakeholders, gather feedback, and iterate as necessary. Be prepared to make adjustments based on user needs and feedback.

6. Implement the designs: Once the designs are finalized, start implementing them in your React app. Update your components and pages to match your designs, and ensure your app works as expected.

7. Test: Perform usability testing to identify any potential issues and gather feedback from real users. Make any necessary adjustments to improve the user experience.

By following these steps, you'll be able to design and implement an effective user interface for your application. Remember to keep your users in mind, focusing on creating a clear, easy-to-use experience that meets their needs.

## Components

Many fundamental components are already provided by Material-UI. You can use these components to build your application. You can also create custom components to meet your specific needs.

Our custom components are:

- Header: The header component will contain the application logo, navigation links, and a search bar.

- Footer: The footer component will include links to important pages, such as the terms of service, privacy policy,
  and contact information.

- Navigation: The navigation component will provide links to key sections of the application, such as the discussion
  list, issue list, and expert analysis list.

- Login/Signup form: The login/signup form component will allow users to create an account or login to an existing
  account.

- Discussion list: The discussion list component will display a list of political discussions and enable users to
  filter by topic and sort by relevance, date, or popularity.

- Discussion detail: The discussion detail component will display the full details of a selected discussion,
  including comments and voting results.

- Comment list: The comment list component will display a list of comments for a selected discussion and allow users
  to sort by relevance, date, or popularity.

- Comment form: The comment form component will enable users to add comments to a selected discussion.
